Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

There are no prerequisites for this course.

Description
-----------

We will devote our time this term to three activities. First, we will study the history of the book in Europe from Gutenberg (ca. 1450) to the French Revolution (ca. 1800). Second, we will examine in detail books and prints in the collections of the MIT Libraries and the MIT Museum made from 1450 to 1800 in Europe. Third, we will build a functioning, durable printing press based on Early Modern European designs. The printing press will eventually reside in the [Beaver Press Print Shop](http://beaverpress.mit.edu/). These three activities are designed to provide a holistic view of print and its impact from roughly 1450 to 1800. Along the way, we will also pause periodically to consider the parallels between the world of print in the Early Modern period and the rapidly changing media landscape today. Was there a "printing revolution" in the Renaissance? Are we living through another media revolution today?

Printing Press Construction
---------------------------

Our goal is to complete construction of our printing press by the end of Week 11, leaving us three weeks to learn how to be handset printers.
