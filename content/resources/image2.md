  caption: '[Tympan](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/dictionary/t/tympan) - A
    frame covered with parchment, on which the sheet of paper to be printed is placed.
    This is the outer tympan; the inner tympan fits into it, and between the parchments
    of the two the blankets are placed, all which being run in receive the pressure
    of the platen, which produces the impression on the paper.


    [Frisket](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/dictionary/f/frisket) - A thin
    iron frame, covered with paper, and connected temporarily with the tympan, by
    means of joints attached to it and the headband of the tympan, having iron pins
    to slip into them.

    to fasten types in to print with.


    [Quoins](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/dictionary/q/quoins) - Short pieces
    of beech wood, made of the same height as furniture, and tapering in their width,
    to wedge the pages up with in a chase.


    [Form](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/dictionary/f/form) - The pages when
    they are imposed and locked up in a chase are called a Form.


    [Furniture](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/dictionary/f/furniture) - The
    term furniture includes all those pieces of wood that are used in branching out

    when they are imposed.


    [Coffin](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/dictionary/c/coffin) - That part
    of a wooden press, in which the stone is bedded.


    [Spindle](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/dictionary/s/spindle) - The screw
    to which the bar of the press is affixed, and which produces the pressure on the
    platen.


    [Platen](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/dictionary/p/platen) - The platen
    is that part of the machine which comes down upon the form, and, being acted upon
    by the spindle, produces the impression.'
