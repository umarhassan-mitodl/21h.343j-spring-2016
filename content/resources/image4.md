  caption: '[Till, or Shelf](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/dictionary/t/till)
    - A mahogany shelf, in wooden presses, divided in two longitudinally, that clasps
    the hose, and causes it and the spindle to come down perpendicularly without any
    play.


    [Spindle](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/dictionary/s/spindle) - The screw
    to which the bar of the press is affixed, and which produces the pressure on the
    platen.


    [Hose](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/dictionary/h/hose) - Two upright bars
    of iron that connected the garter and the hose hooks, and went through the till.'
